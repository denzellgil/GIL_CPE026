Hi! I am Ron Denzell D. Gil, I am 24 years old 4th year Computer Engineering student at Technological Institute of the Philippines - Quezon City. I'm a tech geek, I am fascinated by the world of computer electronics and I like watching tech news dailies in YouTube from Hardware Unboxed, Linus Tech Tips, Gamer's Nexus etc. I also watch a variety of shows whether it is anime like Jujutsu Kaisen <- My current favorite), Attack on Titan, Black Clover (I do plan to watch CSM, Solo levelling) and also Western shows like Reacher, The Boys, Invincible or any mature shows. I am also an avid gamer. I personally love playing any genre ranging from MMORPGs, MOBAs, FPS etc.
